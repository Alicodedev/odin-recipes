<p>Fattoush is one of the most well known Middle Eastern salads and a standard dish on the 
'mezza' (small dishes) table. It's a colorful tossed salad with a lemony garlic dressing, 
and if you've never made a single Arabic dish, this is a delicious and healthy place to start.</p><!-- p tag for paragraphs -->
